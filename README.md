# UCLA - Fall 2012 - CS 268 Machine Perception
### Professor: Stefano Soatto

## Homework 4

For assignment prompt, see `HW4.pdf`.

## Activity

The homework was due November 27, 2012. Since the deadline has passed I've moved onto other assignments. I hope to return to this assignment to finish it with sufficient documentation. My goal is simply to make this a decent reference for using OpenCV in Python as cv2 to do intrinsic calibration and pose estimation.
